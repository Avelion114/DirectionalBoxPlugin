The DirectionalBoxComponent is a custom UBoxComponent that is meant to return directional info on overlap events.
When an overlap event is registered the appropriate side of the box that the object entered or exited will be returned with the standard overlap info. 
The DirectionalBoxComponent also is equipped with a visualizer which has parameters exposed to the editor for custom visualization of directions.
